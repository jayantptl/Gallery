# Gallery
The Image Gallery web application initially authenticates the user using JWT authentication and allows the user to interact with images that are fetched in a batch of six images, once the user reaches the bottom of the browser viewport and allows infinite scroll.

Applications is created using MERN stack where Express app handles the authentication at the server side and images are fetched and rendered at the client side using React. MongoDB stores the user's emails and passwords in an encrypted form.
